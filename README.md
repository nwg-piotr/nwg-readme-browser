# nwg-readme-browser

This program searches the `/usr/share/doc` path for `README.*` files and creates their preview in WebKit2.WebView. 
It supports .md, .rst, .html and plain text. It does not support .pdf format. Instead of all, it may display only 
the README.* files associated to packages enumerated in the config file.
